## Program
The program is carried out using Python. It is a sortable algorithm which dealt with a hand of 3 poker cards. The main challenge here is that we can't simply sort the rank alone, as each poker card is accompanied by its suit as well. With the suit being a String, and the rank being an integer. The goal of the program is to sort the card without interupt the combination of suits and ranks.
## Unit Test

The features that is being tested here are :
- Sorting hands of card with rank {10, 7, 3}.
